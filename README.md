# ASCII Art Generator

Turn your images into stylized text — all in your browser.

---

## How It Works

### Upload an Image
- Drag and drop a `.png` or `.jpeg` image into the app  
- Or click the upload area to browse your device  
- Your image is processed **entirely in the browser** — never sent to a server

### View Instant ASCII Art
- Your image is rendered in ASCII art form using a default character set  
- Output appears immediately on screen

### Adjust Detail
- Use the **detail control** to fine-tune the visual fidelity:
  - `1x` for **high detail** (sharp representation)
  - `128x` for **low detail** (more abstract, stylized view)
- The image re-renders instantly when you adjust this setting

### Customize Character Mapping
- Choose from **built-in presets**
- Or enter your own custom character set
- Characters are mapped from **dark to light**:
  - First characters = **darkest pixels**
  - Last characters = **brightest pixels**

### Copy to Clipboard
- A "Copy" button appears with every render
- Click it to copy the full ASCII art to your clipboard (formatting preserved)
- Paste into any text editor, comment, or code block
